Libcoap client demo:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the following instructions in order to run a simple coap-client demo from command line [Linux terminal]

1. Download and extract libcoap-4.1.1.tar.gz
2. Install libcoap in your home directory by calling ./configure and ./make
3. Switch to the example folder, where the coap-client and coap-server application should be already built.
4. Run the coap-client with no arguments: this will show the application usage.
5. Start the border router and the remote node as usual.
6. GET the well-known resource at the remote node, to discover the installed resoures [the IPv6 address should be the address of the remote node]:
      ./coap-client -m get coap://[aaaa::212:4b00:40f:595a]/.well-known/core
7. GET any installed resource in the same way. Currently only text/plain type is supported, so the CLI command is simple:
      ./coap-client -m get coap://[aaaa::212:4b00:40f:595a]/toggle-led
   Here, we ask for the status of the LED; the resource is called "toggle-led"
8. PUSH or PUT requests for installed resources are executed similarly. For example:
      ./coap-client -m put -e led=toggle coap://[aaaa::212:4b00:40f:595a]/toggle-led
   Here we request a toggle of the device LED

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resources currently installed:

1. Toggle the user LED:

   Get the status of the LED:
     ./coap-client -m get coap://[aaaa::212:4b00:40f:595a]/toggle-led

   Toggle the LED:
     ./coap-client -m put e- led=toogle coap://[aaaa::212:4b00:40f:595a]/toggle-led

2. Get the list of IPv6 neighbors of an IPv6 node:
     ./coap-client -m get coap://[aaaa::212:4b00:40f:595a]/ipv6/neighbors

3. Get specific  RPL information:

  - Address of the parent node:
     ./coap-client -m post -e info=parent coap://[aaaa::212:4b00:40f:595a]/rpl/info

  - Rank of a node:
     ./coap-client -m post -e info=rank coap://[aaaa::212:4b00:40f:595a]/rpl/info

  - Link metric of node-parent link:
     ./coap-client -m post -e info=link_metric coap://[aaaa::212:4b00:40f:595a]/rpl/info
